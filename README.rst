Jenkins Job Builder takes simple descriptions of Jenkins_ jobs in YAML_ or JSON_
format and uses them to configure Jenkins. You can keep your job descriptions in
human readable text format in a version control system to make changes and
auditing easier. It also has a flexible template system, so creating many
similarly configured jobs is easy.

The repository is fored from [jenkins job builder](https://github.com/openstack-infra/jenkins-job-builder).

Base the jenkins job builder repository, more feature should be developed:

1) Provide restful api more than cli to be intergrated with own devops platform more easily.

2) Additional operations(run, get build status) be supported for jenkins jobs.

3) role manage for jenkins jobs
